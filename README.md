# üìù README: Resolved Issues in the Project

This README documents the **resolved issues** in the migration project and improvements related to the `role` module and Postman tests.

## 1. **Potential Race Condition in Role Update**

**Affected file:** `api/role/role.service.ts`  
**Line:** 146  

**Problem description:**  
In the role update method, there was a potential race condition between checking for duplicates and creating the role, which could allow the creation of duplicate roles if both operations were executed simultaneously.

**Solution applied:**
- Implemented a **transaction** in Prisma to ensure that role verification and creation are executed atomically.
- Added a **unique constraint** at the database level to ensure no duplicate roles can be created.

---

## 2. **Error Handling in Role Assignment**

**Affected file:** `api/role/role.service.ts`  
**Line:** 220  

**Problem description:**  
In the `assignRoleToSubject` method, when a duplicate assignment (P2002 error) was detected, it was silently ignored, which could be confusing for clients.

**Solution applied:**
- Modified the error handling to either:
  - Return a **success response** with a message indicating the role was already assigned.
  - Or throw a **specific exception** that the client can handle properly.

---

## 3. **Missing Input Validation**

**Problem description:**  
The `roleName` in `createRoleDto` and `updateRoleDto` lacked length validation. Additionally, `subjectId` and `roleId` were not validated to ensure they were positive numbers, and `subjectType` was not validated to ensure it was a valid value.

**Solution applied:**
- **Added validations** to the DTOs:
  - `roleName`: Ensured its length is within a valid range.
  - `subjectId` and `roleId`: Validated to ensure they are positive numbers.
  - `subjectType`: Validated to ensure it is a valid value from a predefined list.

## 4. **Using Postman Environment for Token Management**

**Problem description:**  
Updating the Postman collection required manually updating the authorization token in each request, which was error-prone and difficult to maintain.

**Solution applied:**
- Implemented a **Postman environment file** to dynamically handle the authorization token, eliminating the need for manual updates.
- Added an example of using `sed` for automation, but now everything is managed through the Postman environment.

---

## 5. **Missing Postman Tests for `deassign`**

**Problem description:**  
The Postman test collection didn't include tests for the **`deassign`** endpoint, which is crucial for validating the removal of assigned roles.

**Solution applied:**
- **Added tests** for the `deassign` endpoint in the Postman collection, ensuring that the system correctly handles role removals.

---

## 6. **Missing Postman Tests for `hasRole`**

**Problem description:**  
The Postman test collection didn't include tests for the **`hasRole`** endpoint, which verifies if a subject has an assigned role.

**Solution applied:**
- **Added tests** for the `hasRole` endpoint in the Postman collection, ensuring that role verification functionality is fully covered.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Summary of improvements made**

- **Race condition control** in role update via transactions and unique constraints.
- **Improved error handling** in role assignment, ensuring that duplicate errors are handled properly.
- **Input validation** in DTOs to ensure correct and consistent data.
- **Automated token management** in Postman using environment variables to avoid manual edits.
- **Added Postman tests** for the `deassign` and `hasRole` endpoints, completing the test coverage.
